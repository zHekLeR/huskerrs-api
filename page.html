<h1>zHekLeR's bot for warzone stats and such</h1>
<p></p>
<p>This bot (and API) was originally designed just for use in HusKerrs' chat.</p>
<p>I adapted a few games and other functionality into it just for fun but these can be enabled/disabled per channel.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You don't necessarily need to add my account as a bot.</p>
<p>I have the source code for this project available <a href=https://github.com/zHekLeR/huskerrs-api>here</a>.</p>
<p>You can clone the soure code or just copy the important bits, then replace the Twitch bot code and COD API code with your own credentials.</p>
<p>If you're not sure how to set it up, feel free to DM me on Twitch or Discord, I'll include those below.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To select the functions that you would like from the bot, click <a href=https://huskerrs-api.herokuapp.com/bot/authenticate>here</a>.</p>
<p>I'll include some base commands to enable/disable the features in the link which describes them below.</p>
<p>There will also be a command !zhekleave to have the bot leave your channel.</p>
<p>If you want to add it back, just visit the above link again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also feel free to message me with any questions, errors, or suggestions. I like to help out.</p>
